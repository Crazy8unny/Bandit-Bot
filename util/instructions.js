**Noughts and Crosses** (also known as **tic tac toe**, or **XO**) is a simple and fun game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

When you start a game of **Noughts and Crosses** with someone, you will need to place your marker (either an **X** or an **O**) on the grid. To do this, you must specify a number from 1-9. Each number represents a square on the grid. \`1\` would be top-left and \`9\`would be bottom right, \`5\` would be the middle square and so on. The person who initiates the game will be player 1 and will play as **X**. The second player will be playing as **O**. **X** will start the match by simply typing a message containing the number of the palce they want to play in _only_! If the message contains any characters other than a number between 1 and 9, nothing will happen. Whenever a new mark is placed, the bot will resend the image of the board. This way you can view the history of the game.

__**Note: You can only play in 1 game at once!**__
