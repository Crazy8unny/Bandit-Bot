        <b>Tilde</b> is a simple discord bot for games on discord servers. It has minigames such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Noughts and Crosses</li>
              <li>21 (Twenty One)</li>
              <li>Coinflip</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many more games are in the porcess of being added! You can view our games todo list <a href="/todo/games">here</a>.
        <br><b>Tilde</b> also has a sound engine, allowing it to stream soundtracks from YouTube (like <b>Rythm</b>); however, <b>Tilde</b> also has features that other music bots do not! Some examples of these are: 
      </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Favourite Songs</li>
              <li>Like and Dislike Songs</li>
              <li>Play songs up to 3 hours long (<b>Rythm</b> only plays up to 2 hours!)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          Our team are also working on competitions or tornaments, in whick people play each other in a series of rounds, the loser getting eleminated each round. The winner would get a prize (maybe some bot-money, etc.).

        An in-depth description of some of <b>Tilde</b>'s games.
      </h4></center>
      <h4 class="gametitle">Noughts and Crosses</h4>
        <p class="gamedesc column">
Noughts and Crosses (also known as tic tac toe, or XO) is a simple and fun game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

When you start a game of Noughts and Crosses with someone, you will need to place your marker (either an X or an O) on the grid. To do this, you must specify a number from 1-9. Each number represents a square on the grid. 1 would be top-left and 9would be bottom right, 5 would be the middle square and so on. The person who initiates the game will be player 1 and will play as X. The second player will be playing as O. X will start the match by simply typing a message containing the number of the palce they want to play in only! If the message contains any characters other than a number between 1 and 9, nothing will happen. Whenever a new mark is placed, the bot will resend the image of the board. This way you can view the history of the game.
      </p>
      <br><br><br>
      
      <h4 class="gametitle">Twenty One (<b>21</b>)</h4>
        <p class="gamedesc column">
Twenty One (also known as 21) is a turn-based game where each player can count up 3 consecutive numbers from the current number. The players have to try not to say 21, beacause the user who has to say 21 immediately loses! 

When a game of 21 is initiated, other players need to join (you cannot play against yourself!) and so you are given a gameID. For other players to join your game, they need to write <b>~join &lt;game ID&gt;</b>, which automatically joins them to the game they specified. To play, you need to specify the number you wish to go to, but you can only go up by a maximum of 3! For example, if the number is 12 and I want to go to 15, instead of typeing 13, 14, 15, I would simply write 15! The turns are ordered chronologically in the way of joining (i.e. the turns are according to when you join - if you join the game second, you would have your turn second!). The player who initiates the game is always the first player.
      </p>
      <br><br><br>
      
      <h4 class="gametitle">Coinflip (Heads or Tails)</h4>
        <p class="gamedesc column">
Coinflip is a very basic game - probably the most simple game ever! All it is is flipping a coin. When <b>~coinflip</b> is sent, the bot flips a coin for you and sends you back the result. This is a 1 player game.

          Has a couple of bugs, but the devs will see to it very soon. It lacks variety - it only has 2 games really, Noughts and Crosses and 21. It is fun with those basic games though - and I hope to see more games in the near future!
