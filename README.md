Discordbot Template
===================
A simple boilerplate template for a discord bot!

Instructions
------------
1) Put your bot token in _.env_ where it says **TOKEN**
2) Put the prefix of the bot in _settings/configuration.json_
3) Put the ID of the official Support Guild for the bot in _.env_ where it says **OFFICIAL_GUILD**
4) Configure _util/permissions.js_ with the role IDs of the server if you want. Otherwise, simply delete that section.
5) In _bot.js_, fill the _commands_ object with commands for your bot. The template command is the `ping` command, which has already been done.

- The run function of a command takes three parameters: `message`, `args` and `data` (or `settings`). The `message` is the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) [message object](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Message). You can find the contents of the message by using `message.content`. `args`, on the other hand, is an array of all the arguments of the command (the words after the command word seperated by spaces). For example, if someone wrote the command `shoot gun car`, the command would be `shoot`, `args[0]` would be _gun_ and `args[1]` would be _car_. The final parameter, `data` or `settings`, is an array of some miscellaneous data about the message, bot or anything else!

- The command name should match the key for the command, but with a capital letter to begin with (this is just common convention). Here is an example command:
```
commands = {
    help:
    {
        name: "Help",
        description: "Displays a help message",
        category: "General",
        arguments: ["-o command"],
        permission: 1,
        usage: `${prefix}help`,
        exampleusage: `${prefix}help ping`,
        run: function(message, args, data)
        {
            message.delete();
            message.channel.send("Hello! Type `" + prefix + "commands` to see all of my commands!");
        }
    }
}
```
